I am a Data Scientist with experience in Life Insurance, Pension Consulting and Machine Learning industries possessing an advanced understanding of data analytics and the ability it has to bring more value to data than ever before.

I have a strong passion for statistical modelling and a drive to innovate, while encouraging others to do the same. Companies have the opportunity to be a the forefront of their respective industries with the aid of statistical modelling and analytical techniques. These techniques present business units with the ability to improve processes, identify opportunities to differentiate and disrupt markets.

As I develop, I strive to help companies progress further than previously possible; continually seeking ways to promote change while conveying a strong understanding of techniques and applications to individuals of all experience levels. An innate curiosity fuels my ambition to improve and I am excited to see what can be accomplished as new challenges present themselves, requiring creative and efficient solutions.
