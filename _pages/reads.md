### Introduction

It's easy to find excuses to not read, up until recently I had mastered it. 

+ I am tired from work
+ I play in sports leagues
+ I want to spend time with my significant other
+ The dishes won't do themselves
+ Netflix has The Office and Facebook says it might be taken off so re-watching it should be my priority.

As I debated picking up a book vs my endless stream of excuses, it seemed like I was operating under the assumption that I will take a quick detour from reading, but **will** revisit it.
Fast-forward 5 years later and I cannot think of a single time when I grabbed a book and a hot drink and found the most comfortable spot on the couch --which was without doubt in some obscure contorted position.

When I was younger, we had a futon in our living room.  
On sunny days glass sliding doors which led to the back patio concentrated the light on the futon.  Like dogs always finding the sunspot on the carpet, our family would race to the futon with a novel in hand and remain there until the sunspot faded.
I spent hours and hours sprawled out on the radiating futon experiencing every trial and tribulation of Matt Cruise on the Aurora, finding horcruxes with Harry and imagining the size of the billboards in Guy Montag's future America. 
I romanticized reading, I loved getting lost within the words, letting the imagery transport me to a different place *floating* above the characters.  It didn't matter if it was fiction or non-fiction, the futon acted as a teleporter.
By no means was I a bookworm, but when I found time to be on the futon it was consuming.

Once I got to university I was flooded with technical statistical and actuarial texts laiden with rigorous proofs, theory and lemmas.  I quickly lost my desire to get lost in the words, the imagery subsided, and the luscious landscapes faded to blank canvases constrained by series of braces, summations and integrals.
Almost overnight my romanticization of reading vanished.  Like Robert Langdon's ability to look at passages of text and extract only key syntax to solve clues to find the Holy Grail, my eyes scoured pages, looking for equations, bold text and key pieces of information.  So started my endless excuses to avoid reading at all costs.

There are some confounding variables which may explain why my desire to read diminished.  It is not surpising to me that age and passion for reading are inversley proportional.  The difference between being young and an adult are obligations and responsibilities.  I did not fill my life with statisical texts for fun, I did so to further my understanding of the fundamental concepts essential for my development as a Data Scientist/Actuary.  
Our priorities change, and what I noticed was that not only was reading not desirable to me, I wasn't good at it any more.  Even when I would venture back to non-technical reads, I couldn't get lost in the texts as easily.  My eyes no longer read left to right, it was fantic scouring of a page to quickly parse texts.  I did not read each work sequentially, I read one word and looked at which words surrounded it to arrive at a more succinct representation to figure out where the author is going rather than enjoying the journey.

In winter of 2018, my girlfriend and I took a trip to Cuba.  We were looking forward to the crystal blue ocean water and white sand beaches.  We were staying at a resort on a small island and the excursions were not as cultural as we would have liked so we took this as an opportunity to relax.  

Our days started with Bailey's and coffee in the morning before a quick breakfast then rushing to the beach.  We became friends with the resort employee who managed the beach chairs and he started saving the best chairs for us, close enough to the bar for mojitos, perfect sun exposure and close to the beach.  A
s the sun touched the beach chairs, I was transported to my sun soaked futon and my passion for reading began to flicker.  Before the trip I told my girlfriend I am going to start reading for joy again.  She was glad to hear I wanted to dig into a book again. As I began packing I took three books and piled them into my suitcase, she started laughing and I knew why.  
Here is a guy who hasn't read a book in years and he piles three significant reads into a small suitcase causing the zipper to strain...perhaps I should start with a picture book and make my way back to novels.  I laughed with her and said just you wait by the end of our trip 3 books will be read.

The books I brought were:
1. Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell [Purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?crid=145NWALSJJEQZ&keywords=outliers+malcolm+gladwell&qid=1583859496&sprefix=outliers+%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-1)
2. Achievement Habit [Purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Achievement-Habit-Wishing-Start-Command/dp/0062356100/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2DWSMTGC4RUZM&keywords=achievement+habit&qid=1583859546&sprefix=achievement%2Caps%2C141&sr=8-1)
3. Innovators Dilemma [Purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Cause-Great/dp/1633691780/ref=sr_1_1?crid=J283HMXSTD0T&keywords=innovators+dilemma&qid=1583859593&sprefix=innovators%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1)

One area of study I am interested in is leadership.  I have been actively seeking a book that provides an overview of the greatest and controversial leaders in human history.
To satisfy this interest I chose books that speak to what makes some people extraordinary.
